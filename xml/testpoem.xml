    <title>Let's Think of Eggs</title>
   
       <author>Ogden Nash</author>
    
      <stanza> Let’s think of eggs—
        They have no legs!
        Chickens come from eggs,
        But they have legs…</stanza>
    
      
       <stanza>The plot thickens: 
           Eggs come from chickens
           But have no legs under ‘em—
           What a conundrum!
       </stanza>
